# For this part of assignment 4, we'll use a simple CNN-LSTM architecture with a Resnet-152 backbone for image captioning. The CNN will be used to extract features from the images, and the LSTM will be used to decode the features into a sentence. The model is already pretrained from before. You'll just need to write the forward pass of the encoder and a sampling function for the lstm decoder to generate output captions.
# 
# For testing, we'll use 16 randomly sampled image-caption pairs from the [Microsoft COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home) which is the standard testbed for image captioning. The dataset consists of 80,000 training images and 40,000 validation images, each annotated with 5 captions written by workers at Amazon Mechanical Turk. The sample image-caption pairs are available under `data/exercise-4/sample_image_caption_pairs.pkl` and the function for loading them is given in the code cell below.
# 
# Dealing with strings is inefficient, so we will work with an encoded version of the captions. Each word is assigned an integer ID, allowing us to represent a caption by a sequence of integers. The mapping between integer IDs and words is done in `utils/build_vocab.py` and the corresponding vocabulary file is available under `data/exercise-4/vocab.pkl`.
# There are a couple of special tokens that we add to the vocabulary. We prepend a special `<START>` token and append an `<END>` token to the beginning and end of each caption respectively. Rare words are replaced with a special `<UNK>` token (for "unknown"). In addition, since the models were trained with minibatches containing captions of different lengths, we pad short captions with a special `<pad>` token after the `<END>` token.

# ## Inference steps for CNN and LSTM (15 points)

# %% [markdown]
# There are overall 3 `TODOs` for this exercise. Write the forward pass for the CNN encoder in `models/captioning/cnn.py` and the inference and decoding steps for the lstm in `models/captioning/lstm.py`. For more details, please refer to the individual modules. The `forward` function provided for the lstm decoder cannot be used at inference time as it uses the ground truth captions as the input to the decoder at each timestep, and not the word it generated in the previous timestep. This is usual during training as this helps in faster convergence of the model. This is also known as `Teacher Forcing`. 
# 
# The code below is designed to work for a single input image and caption pair from the pickle file, but feel free to modify it to run for the entire batch of 16 pairs provided.

# ### Comparing BLEU scores for Beam Search and Greedy Approaches (5 points)

# %% [markdown]
# The straightforward option while decoding with the lstm is to choose the word with the highest score at each step and use it to predict the next word. But this is not optimal because the rest of the sequence hinges on that first word you choose. If that choice isn't the best, everything that follows is sub-optimal. And it's not just the first word â€“ each word in the sequence has consequences for the ones that succeed it. For example, the best possible sequence might include the second best word at the first step, third best word at the second step, and so on. So it's better to somehow not decide until we've finished decoding completely, and choose the sequence that has the highest overall score from a list of candidate sequences. This is the idea behind beam search. Beam Search is useful for any language modeling problem because it finds the most optimal sequence. 
# 
# However, you don't need to implement beam search for this exercise. It's already given in the LSTM decoder class. You can use the beam search implementation as hint for implementing the greedy search.

# %% [markdown]
# For evaluating model performance in captioning, BLEU (BiLingual Evaluation Understudy) score is a commonly used metric. This evaluates generated captions based on the n-grams (n consecutive words) that are present in the ground truth captions. The BLEU score is a number between 0 and 1, with 1 being the best possible score. The code block below computes the BLEU score for the generated caption. For more details on how BLEU score is calculated, you can refer to the official documentation in NLTK - `https://www.nltk.org/_modules/nltk/translate/bleu_score.html`.
# 
# If you implement the sample function in `models/captioning/lstm.py` correctly, you should ideally get a BLEU score comparable but slightly lower than that for beam search. But that may not always be the case. Also, usually, BLEU-1 score is the highest while BLEU-4 is the lowest for a given reference and ground truth caption pair.
